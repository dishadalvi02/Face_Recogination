# FACE RECOGNITION SYSTEM - Classify Faces Using SVM and MTCNN ü§ñ

The **Face Recognition System** is an ML-based project that detects and classifies faces from images. By using MTCNN for face detection, FaceNet for generating embeddings, and SVM for classification, it enables the identification of faces from uploaded images. The system is powered by machine learning and can be run using a graphical user interface (GUI) or via Google Colab for cloud-based execution.

üöÄ **Features**
- **Face Detection**: Uses MTCNN to accurately detect faces in images.
- **Face Recognition**: Classifies detected faces using a pre-trained SVM model based on facial embeddings generated by FaceNet.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Simple and intuitive interface for local use.
- **Cloud-based Testing**: Can also be run in Google Colab for cloud-based testing without setup on a local machine.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Once the image is uploaded, the face is processed and the predicted identity is shown instantly.

üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**:
  - OpenCV for image processing
  - MTCNN for face detection
  - Keras and TensorFlow for deep learning and embeddings (FaceNet)
  - Tkinter for the GUI interface
  - Joblib for loading pre-trained models
- **Pre-trained Models**:
  - **SVM** for classification based on facial embeddings.
  - **FaceNet** for generating facial embeddings.
  - **MTCNN** for face detection.

### Results

Here are some expected results when using the Face Recognition System:

1. **Successful Prediction**:
   - If a face is detected, the system will display the predicted identity.
   - output:
     ```
     Predicted class
     ```

2. **No Face Detected**:
   - If no face is detected in the image, the system will print:
     ```
     No face detected
     ```

## How It Works

The system is composed of several parts:

1. **Face Detection**: MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) is used to detect faces from the uploaded image.
2. **Face Embedding Generation**: FaceNet generates a 512-dimensional embedding for the detected face.
3. **Face Classification**: The embedding is passed through a pre-trained SVM model that classifies the identity of the face.
4. **GUI or Colab**: 
   - If running on your local machine, the Tkinter GUI will allow you to upload an image and see the prediction immediately.
   - Alternatively, in Colab, you can upload images and get predictions directly in the notebook.
